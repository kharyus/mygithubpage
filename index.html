		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<p> I'm Crístian and this is my website for showcasing projects I've done. It's still under construction and any feedback is very welcome. </p>
		<p> I really like Programming. I think I might like learning about programming more than actual programming though. I have been experimenting with Functional Programming using Haskell, and I quite like it. However I wanted to make a game on it to learn it deeper, but I've yet to understand the State monad(if that's even what I'm supposed to be using).
		    Well I think I already have a grasp on monads(my understanding is that they are used to glue functions together so that may be performed in sequence) so that's kinda nice.</p>
		<p> Other than Programming, I also really like Fighting games, although I have not had the chance to practice since I've come to Canada. My computer stayed in my home country along with all my dreams of being any good at those games.</p>
		<p> Enjoy your stay at my website! </p>
